# Full Mathlib checkpoints in Colib CI

## Conditions and observed regression

The first complete Aglib-style adaptation was Colib `e29879e`, based on Aglib
`1943d6e`, with Lean 4.34.0-rc2, Mathlib `16edf57`, and Stacks `f8e70c5`.
It ran all checks successfully on hosted Ubuntu with 13,824 MiB native scopes,
one Lake thread and two declaration-lint workers. The linter actually reported
`backend=batched`, 7,045 Colib declarations, 15 linters, and two workers.

| Run | Build | Test | Source/measurement limit |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| [42153596620](https://github.com/kangxyz/colib/actions/runs/42153596620) | 492 s | 276 s | Last successful portable workflow, source `439de50` |
| [42159181569](https://github.com/kangxyz/colib/actions/runs/42159181569) | 507 s | 449 s | First full layered run, source `e29879e` |
| [42159959033](https://github.com/kangxyz/colib/actions/runs/42159959033) | 525 s | 580 s | Next main run, source `2bccd32`; additional mathematics prevents a controlled compile-time comparison |

The first layered dependency archive contained 132,983 generated files and
2,234,762,974 compressed bytes. Dependency packing cost 140 seconds. Test spent
71 seconds downloading it, 97 seconds restoring it, and 72 seconds scanning/packing
the tools layer. Stacks was a separate 5,535-file, 115,325,096-byte checkpoint.
The whole-run observations do not establish a universal speed ratio, but the
step timings directly identify substantial dependency-transport work.

## Repair

Retain the verified Aglib workflow and independent functional steps. Compiler
progress and success logs stay visible. No checks are grouped to hide their status.

The repair excludes official Mathlib production outputs from dependency and tools
checkpoint scopes, and acquires the pinned official cache in both hosted jobs.
Only Mathlib's small checker-tool output directories enter the tools checkpoint.
The dependency/tools context binds the changed scope policy; root and Stacks
contexts remain compatible. Stacks remains independently stored.

Resource limits, scope quiescence, staging repair, same-run production verification,
complete package checks and the pinned axiom audit remain. The same-host path
retains Build's Mathlib tree and skips the cross-runner acquisition/transport.

The earlier combined-check wrapper change was reverted. It obscured stage status
without reducing verification work. A regression test now checks the substantive
boundary: the dependency archive contains no Mathlib production outputs, while the
tools archive retains the required checker executable.

## Live validation

`ci-timings.json` records the original observations. Repaired-path timings will be
appended after the independent native stages complete. No EC2 trial is performed
while its admission gate remains false.

## Idle-build diagnosis

Run 42167622185 performed no Lean compilation during its 187-second production
Build step (05:20:15–05:23:22 UTC). Thirteen process samples recorded zero Lean
frontends, about 0.99 native CPU cores on average, and under 1 GiB aggregate native
memory. The log contains no compiled-module action and ends with 5,702 Lake jobs.
This separates Lake graph/hash/cache work from theorem elaboration.

Remove Build's forced `--rehash`; retain the native `--no-build --rehash` validity
check in Test. The production build remains incremental. The pinned Lake
`BuildConfig.showProgress` and `reportResult` control progress/completion separately
from per-job log severity, so `--log-level=error` suppresses replayed upstream logs
without replacing the native completion result. Explicit builtin lint continues
to target `Colib`, using its defining-module filter.

The first incremental comparison, run 42168962352, took 181 seconds in production
Build versus 187 seconds with forced rehash. Removing forced hashes alone is not
the dominant improvement. The next controlled change sets the existing upstream
`build-lake-threads` input to four on hosted runners (eight on EC2); the observed
idle workload used approximately one of the hosted runner's four CPUs. Its effect
must be measured rather than inferred from the setting.

## Native artifact hydration and build concurrency

The four-thread production comparison (run 42169705448) took 55 seconds versus
181 seconds with one thread, on the same mathematical source and memory limit.
This is a measured result, not a general scaling guarantee.

Pinned Lake `Module.recBuildLean` calls `cacheOutputArtifacts` after finding
up-to-date filesystem outputs when the package native artifact cache is writable.
`Cache.saveArtifact` reads and hashes those contents. Global
`LAKE_ARTIFACT_CACHE=true` therefore hydrates dependencies into a fresh native
store despite their existing official/working caches.

Use workspace default `LAKE_ARTIFACT_CACHE=false`, while retaining Colib's explicit
`enableArtifactCache=true` in its package file. Package settings take precedence;
all ten pinned dependency configurations lack an explicit enable setting. Colib
still records root native mappings and LTARs for staging/publication; dependencies
retain their ordinary generated files and official/independent caches. Native
strict Test verification remains the runtime applicability gate. Source references:
`Lake/Config/Monad.lean:192–203`, `Config/Workspace.lean:133–143`,
`Build/Module.lean:1056–1120`, and `Build/Common.lean:453–505`, at Lean4.34.0-rc2.
The effect of this policy is measured in the next native run.

## Final measured result

[Run 42171643965](https://github.com/kangxyz/colib/actions/runs/42171643965), source
`d47c744`, passed Build, all independently reported native checks and both cache
publications. Its `Colib/` and `ColibTest/` source trees are identical to baseline
`a36cec7` (run 42163110999); compiler and mathematical pins are unchanged.

| Phase | Full-layered baseline | Final repair |
|---|---:|---:|
| Production Build step | 302 s | 61 s |
| Dependency checkpoint packing | 98 s | 5 s |
| Current dependency overlay | 137 s | 19 s |
| Tools checkpoint packing | 99 s | 5 s |
| Build job | 770 s | 257 s |
| Test/check job | 472 s | 268 s |

Build plus Test decreased from 1,242 seconds (20m42s) to 525 seconds (8m45s).
These are individual CI observations, not an unbounded speed guarantee or a
pure compiler microbenchmark. The cache-scope costs and four-thread comparison
were measured separately. The native-default-false comparison alone was 53 s
versus 55 s with four threads: it removed upstream artifact registration by
source policy but did not establish a material additional timing benefit.
The final Mathlib acquisition step took 34 s after restoring bootstrap outputs,
versus 110 s in the preceding bootstrap-order run.

Builtin, text and declaration lint remained scoped to defining Colib modules.
The final batched run checked 8,382 Colib declarations with all 15 selected
linters. No dependency declaration-lint targets were added. The EC2 path shares
the policy/resource changes and retains same-host handoff; admission stayed false,
so these runtime measurements cover hosted Ubuntu only.

## Missing Colib root checkpoint on EC2

[Run 43154057907](https://github.com/kangxyz/colib/actions/runs/43154057907)
missed the root Actions cache and compiled 2,381 Colib modules before
cancellation. The candidate changed eight production Lean files and its
reverse production closure contained 22 modules including the aggregate.
The preceding [main run](https://github.com/kangxyz/colib/actions/runs/43125303247)
had saved the root checkpoint and published 4,338 native output mappings for
`ab836388294fdb492fa5ceb80cd562eaa6e0b4e9`. The published archive was still
available after the Actions cache disappeared.

On a root checkpoint miss, the restore step selects a successful main push
and verifies its published archive before adding its native mappings. The
normal stage validator checks the archive contents. Lake rehashes the current
source and dependency inputs before applying those mappings. The existing
exact checked-branch seed still takes precedence for merge builds.
