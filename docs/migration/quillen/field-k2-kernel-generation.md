# Stable Steinberg kernel generation and central lifting

## Scope and source

This slice continues the actual field K₂ comparison from Quillen revision
`c561118b7795eb9780be9ed391c3251d6a4d0afd`. Its Colib baseline is published main
`95fceadddb4d7c178bb271358d7cfaa51a6664fa`, tree
`8f6fb96d420a1bc1a0ed7774f4d83ff5e57f22b5`.

For every field, the actual stable Steinberg-to-elementary kernel is generated
by its original ordered torus defects. Consequently the existing native map
`StableSteinberg.milnorToKernel F` is surjective. Its domain is the unchanged
Stacks `MilnorKTheory F 2`; no pair-symbol quotient or transport adapter is added.

The same stable Steinberg map is also proved to be a universal central
extension: its group lifts uniquely through every surjective central extension
of the actual stable elementary group. The extension group can occupy an
independent universe. This is a constructed lift, not an assumed lifting law.

The continuations below prove Matsumoto injectivity and the comparison with
Quillen K₂ over every field.

## Source correspondence

- `StableSteinbergRankTwo.lean` becomes
  `Colib.GroupTheory.Steinberg.RankTwo`. The actual ordered defect subgroup,
  quotient, root conjugation and rank-two collection prove that the generated
  defect subgroup equals the rank-two stage intersected with the kernel.
  The Milnor range argument is moved to its K-theory owner.
- `StableSteinbergParabolic.lean` becomes `.Parabolic`. It proves actual
  upper-parabolic normal forms, kernel descent, root relocation and the
  nonzero row orbit result with the same finite-root words.
- `StableSteinbergBruhat.lean` becomes `.Bruhat`. Its `B * V * B` coverage is
  proved for source words in the defect quotient. Equal matrix images are
  not used to assert equality of arbitrary Steinberg words.
- `StableSteinbergKernelGeneration.lean` becomes `.KernelGeneration`. Actual
  last-row matrix detection gives one-step stage descent; finite-stage
  induction proves `defectSubgroup_eq_kernel` and `kernel_le_stage_two`.
- The native range argument and final surjectivity consequence are in
  `Colib.RingTheory.KTheory.MilnorK.Steinberg.Surjectivity`. Native tuple-symbol
  generation replaces the former Milnor model's extension API. The forward
  homomorphism and value `h(a) * h(b) * h(a*b)⁻¹` are unchanged.
- `StableSteinbergUniversal.lean` becomes
  `Colib.GroupTheory.Steinberg.Universal`. Commutators of actual elementary
  preimages construct the lift. Centrality, fresh coordinates and Hall–Witt
  prove the four original defining relations; perfectness proves uniqueness.

All source paths above are under `Quillen/Algebra/Group/`. Source attribution
and Apache-2.0 notices are retained. The native matrix types, stable directed
limit, stable presentation and chosen maps are the ones already in Colib.
The defect quotient is a quotient used in the generation proof, not an
alternative model for Milnor K₂. There are no Aglib imports or compatibility
namespaces. Every field is allowed, including fields of order two and three.

## Completed comparison continuations

1. The [Matsumoto continuation](matsumoto-native-injectivity.md) constructs the
   faithful native Milnor-valued detector over infinite fields. Together with
   finite-field vanishing it gives `milnorToKernel_injective`. All-field
   generation then gives the canonical kernel equivalence.
2. The [stable-fiber continuation](field-k2-stable-fiber.md) proves the genuine
   homological inputs, fiber perfectness and bijectivity of the original
   kernel-to-Q.K₂ map. The completion-to-Q-loop map still reverses the inner
   loop exactly once and retains its specified basepoint path.
3. The [final comparison source](field-k2-comparison.md) includes the original
   upper finite-module comparison, forward and inverse field-change squares,
   positive ordered marking and negative normalization over every field.
   The negative normalization is minus the positive inverse.
   Earlier candidate endpoints passed focused native checks within their
   recorded source scope. The separate Lean 4.35 whole-library checks passed for
   published commit `0fd43f0253d6ff441fbc3e82420a0573ad694310` in
   [the original CI run](https://github.com/kangxyz/colib/actions/runs/42373233801).

## Historical slice validation

The six production modules and the in-package
`ColibTest.SteinbergKernelGeneration` test are checked using the pinned toolchain
with `autoImplicit=false`, `warningAsError=true` and Mathlib's standard source
linters. The tests cover all-rank kernel generation, stage descent, actual
Milnor surjectivity and ordered symbols, independent-universe lifting, and the
identity lift of the original central extension to itself.

The full default declaration lint passes for both endpoint import closures.
Native text lint, generated-import checking and catalog validation pass. The
pinned independent axiom auditor checks 892 imported Colib declarations, using
only `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.

These historical focused checks do not validate the later coordinate-rebuilt
closure. That closure's original whole-library CI passed at the exact published
commit linked above; it is distinct from these earlier local checks.
No separate kernel replay, client check or independent mathematical review is
inferred from compilation. Detailed verification output is kept outside the
repository.
