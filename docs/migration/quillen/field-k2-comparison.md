# Matsumoto's theorem for K₂ over every field

## Mathematical attribution

The field K₂ isomorphism is **Matsumoto's theorem**. Its original source is
[Matsumoto (1969), Section 5, Theorem 5.10 and Corollary 5.11, pp. 30–31](https://numdam.org/item/10.24033/asens.1174.pdf#page=31).
The original statement treats central extensions over infinite fields, with
separate symplectic and non-symplectic presentations. Here the non-symplectic
case specializes to stable type A. The existing Milnor K₂ vanishing supplies
the finite-field case. The field K₂ presentation is also stated in
[Weibel, III, Theorem 6.1](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/Kbook/Kbook.III.pdf#page=48).

The further identification with Quillen's homotopy-defined K₂ is a separate
comparison, as in [Weibel, IV, Corollary 1.7.1](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/Kbook/Kbook.IV.pdf#page=6).
Neither the general Milnor-to-Quillen map in arbitrary degree nor its additional
naturality and sign conventions are renamed Matsumoto's theorem. The software
references below record implementation provenance, not mathematical priority.

Original attribution and Apache-2.0 notices are retained in adapted sources.

Library item COL-0262 records the endpoint in
`Colib.RingTheory.KTheory.MilnorK.QuillenEquivalence`. The earlier Lean 4.34 candidate passed
strict endpoint compilation and focused native checks. Those results are
historical. The original characteristic-zero Lean 4.35 integration ports
consumers to the native finite-support simplex and was published at
[`0fd43f0253d6ff441fbc3e82420a0573ad694310`](https://github.com/kangxyz/colib/commit/0fd43f0253d6ff441fbc3e82420a0573ad694310).
Its [original candidate CI](https://github.com/kangxyz/colib/actions/runs/42373233801)
passed the repository-wide build, tests, native lint, axiom audit and Library checks.
This exact-commit result is separate from the earlier focused checks.

## Exact hypotheses, objects and maps

For `F : Type u` with `[Field F]`, the source defines

- `MilnorKTheory.rightProjectiveKTwoEquiv F`, from the Stacks
  `MilnorKTheory F 2` to
  `Additive ((ModuleCat.FiniteProjective.exactStructure.{u,u} Fᵐᵒᵖ).K 2)`.
- `MilnorKTheory.upperModuleKTwoEquiv F`, with the same domain and
  literal target
  `Additive ((abelianExactStructure (FGModuleCat.{u} F)).SmallK.{u+1} 2)`.

Both use `AddEquiv.ofBijective` on the existing homomorphisms
`toRightProjectiveKTwo F` and `toUpperModuleKTwo F`; their forward-homomorphism
identities are `rfl`. The first map is native `StableSteinberg.milnorToKernel`
followed by `steinbergKernelToRightProjectiveKTwo`. The upper map then uses the
actual projective inclusion, opposite-ring restriction and existing upper
SmallModel/common-ambient comparison. The target K-groups remain the realized
Q-construction groups, not a presentation chosen to make the comparison hold.

[Kernel generation](field-k2-kernel-generation.md),
[native Matsumoto injectivity](matsumoto-native-injectivity.md), and the
[stable-fiber proof](field-k2-stable-fiber.md) supply the inputs. Fiber
perfectness is proved for every ring; the original Steinberg-kernel-to-K₂ map's
injectivity and surjectivity are proved over every field. The Milnor
equivalences combine these results with the infinite-field Bruhat detector
and finite-field Milnor K₂ vanishing.

## Ordered product and negative normalization

For every field, `MilnorKTheory.toUpperModuleKTwo_pair_eq_unitProduct` proves

`toUpperModuleKTwo F (milnorKTupleSymbol ![a, b]) = Additive.ofMul (FGModuleCat.FieldSymbols.unitProduct F a b)`.

Here `unitProduct F a b` is the original scalar identity-homotopy action of
`a` on `positiveUnitKOne F b`, which is defined by the inverse of the actual
finite-module determinant equivalence. Neither the product nor the action is
defined through the Milnor equivalence. The ordered kernel word remains
`h(a) * h(b) * h(a*b)⁻¹`, with its positive rank-three commutator marking.
The scalar-cube and connecting-sweep inversions cancel, without swapping `a`
and `b` or discarding the moving vertex track.

`upperModuleKTwoEquiv_pair` gives that same ordered product.
`upperModuleKTwoNegativeEquiv` is
`(upperModuleKTwoEquiv F).symm.trans (AddEquiv.neg _)`.
It sends the actual positive `unitProduct F a b` to
`-milnorKTupleSymbol ![a, b]`; its inverse is minus the original forward map.

## Field change in both directions

For `F L : Type u` and `f : F →+* L`, the original forward squares use
`(ModuleCat.FiniteProjective.rightBaseChangeExact f).KMap 2` and
`(FGModuleCat.finiteModuleExtensionExact f).smallKMap.{u+1} 2`.
They are proved for arbitrary fields in
`Colib.RingTheory.KTheory.MilnorK.QuillenNaturality`. In this common universe, the native
Milnor map agrees with the existing Stacks transport.

The comparison proves these squares for each equivalence and its inverse,
including the negative normalization in both directions. The squares use the
same native coefficient maps in the common universe.

## Native coordinate ownership

The coordinate source set uses the pinned native finite-support
`Convexity.StdSimplex`, its boundary and `SimplexCategory.toTopHomeo` directly. It preserves the actual
realization cylinder/product comparisons, ordered triangle edges, parameter
reversals and full natural-transformation tracks. There is no finite
Finsupp-to-function conversion layer or parallel simplex model.

`FiniteSimplexAdapter.lean` and the duplicate realization
`SimplexBoundary.lean` and `SimplexHomotopy.lean` owners are retired. The actual
native boundary, retraction, homotopy extension and path-homotopy owners remain
under `Colib.Analysis.Convex.StdSimplex`. The substantive
`Colib.Topology.Realization.SimplexBoundary` directory family also remains,
using native coordinates directly. The adapter item `COL-0059` is retired
permanently, never reused; `COL-0082` and `COL-0098` retain their identities with
updated native interfaces.

The metric order complex retains its genuine arbitrary-support Finsupp/L1
object, `chainCoordinates`, and pushforward, support, vertex, composition and
injectivity results. Only the obsolete finite helpers
`continuous_chainCoordinates` and `chainCoordinatesMap` are retired. Their
removal adds no compatibility alias and is not an assertion that every
arbitrary-index helper has a finite native replacement.

## Verification boundary

The first three results below refer to earlier candidate snapshots. The final
item records the completed whole-library verification of the exact Lean 4.35
commit; it does not certify later descendants.

- The general-field positive marking and ordinary
  `ColibTest.PositiveSymbolMarking` regression have frozen strict compilation,
  native text/declaration lint and axiom-audit evidence. Regression coverage
  includes `ZMod 5`, literal scalar/tensor maps, coordinate order and a genuinely
  moving vertex. Its proof closure uses only `propext`, `Classical.choice` and
  `Quot.sound`.
- A focused independent source review checked the final comparison's
  hypotheses, literal maps, ordered marking, signs and both field-change
  directions. It found no mismatch in that reviewed scope. This is not an
  exhaustive review of every lower dependency or a compilation result.
- The final characteristic-zero production endpoint and ordinary regression
  passed strict compilation, native text/declaration lint and a production
  axiom audit on the 1,285-module native coordinate closure. Its 22,130 audited
  declarations use only the three standard axioms. The final annotated
  production sources were checked again; compiled metadata contains all
  15 COL-0262 bindings with their precise Quillen references and no COL-0059.
- For commit `0fd43f0253d6ff441fbc3e82420a0573ad694310`, the
  [original CI run](https://github.com/kangxyz/colib/actions/runs/42373233801)
  completed successfully on November 7, 2026. Both Build and Test/lint/axiom
  jobs passed, including all tests, native text and declaration lint,
  generated-entry checks, the production axiom audit and structured Library
  export. The candidate's cache-publication job was skipped as expected.
  This is a remote whole-library pass, not a claim that the local resource-limited
  environment completed `scripts/check.sh`.

The earlier verification records refer to the original comparison. The
all-field version has in-package examples for the Bruhat detector over
`RatFunc (ZMod 2)` and the Quillen equivalences over `ZMod 2` and `ZMod 3`.
