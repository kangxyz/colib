# Colib EC2 CI

This directory owns the repository-scoped, on-demand EC2 runner for `kangxyz/colib`.
It uses the same [upstream runner module, version 8.0.0](https://github.com/github-aws-runners/terraform-aws-github-runner/tree/v8.0.0)
and Ubuntu bootstrap pattern as Aglib. Colib has its own VPC, runner labels,
launch template, queues, Lambda functions, webhook secret and Terraform state.
Aglib's deployment is not changed. The existing GitHub App key is referenced from
SSM; its private key is not duplicated into this repository or Terraform state.

## Disabled deployment

The initial deployment on 2026-11-06 added 86 managed resources without updating
or deleting existing resources. Its encrypted, versioned state backend is
`colib-ec2-terraform-975049960217`, key `runner/terraform.tfstate`, in `us-east-1`.
The deployment is deliberately dormant:

| Control | Disabled value |
|---|---|
| Repository variable | `COLIB_SELF_HOSTED_ENABLED=false` |
| Terraform input | `enabled=false`, also the default |
| Scale-up Lambda reserved concurrency | `0` |
| Runner maximum | `0` |
| GitHub repository webhook | Inactive |
| Scheduled runner binary synchronization | Disabled |
| EC2 instances and registered Colib runners | None |

`COLIB_EC2_SHARED_HOST=true` prepares the current Aglib-style same-checkout
Build-to-Test handoff; it cannot admit an EC2 job while the separate self-hosted
gate is false. [Lean CI](../../../.github/LEAN_CI.md) owns the full optimized
hosted and self-hosted execution flow.

The repository variable gates both the caller and reusable workflow. The
guarded EC2 profile is the default for owner pushes and manual runs on Colib
branches when enabled. Pull request runs use GitHub-hosted runners.

The deployment creates control infrastructure and a launch template, with no
EC2 instance resource or warm pool. Scheduled housekeeping and idle reclamation
remain available. Dormant control resources and stored objects can have small
AWS costs. An actual EC2 bootstrap/build trial has not been run while disabled.

## Runner configuration

The enabled configuration permits one `m7i.4xlarge` runner (16 vCPU, 64 GiB) in
`us-east-1`, with a 200 GiB encrypted gp3 root disk deleted on termination.
There is no NAT gateway or inbound security-group rule. IMDSv2 is required.
The autoscaler admits only `kangxyz/colib` and requires the exact cumulative labels
`self-hosted,linux,x64,colib-ec2`.

The persistent service has a 900-second idle confirmation and a 360-minute machine
watchdog. Build renews the watchdog using Aglib's timer restart pattern. Build and
Test limits are respectively 240 and 90 minutes on EC2. The root-owned
`/etc/colib-ci-runner-mode` marker identifies a Colib host. Colib and Stacks retain
their [independent cache boundaries](../../../docs/CACHING.md) on either runner
profile; this adapter does not introduce a shared cache containing both packages.

## Deployment inputs and state

Use Terraform 1.13.5 and the committed provider lock. Authenticate through AWS CLI
to the intended account, then configure the Terraform AWS provider for that CLI
profile. An AWS CLI login profile can be exposed to the provider through a local
`credential_process` that runs `aws configure export-credentials --format process`.
Keep that local AWS configuration outside Git.

Create these prerequisites before planning:

- A private, encrypted, versioned S3 state bucket, with public access blocked and
  S3 lockfiles enabled through `use_lockfile = true` in the backend configuration.
- An existing GitHub App key in a SecureString parameter named by
  `github_app_key_ssm_name`, stored as base64-encoded PEM as required by upstream.
- A separate random webhook secret in SecureString
  `/<prefix>/app/webhook-secret` (`/colib-ec2/app/webhook-secret` by default).
- A local variables file based on `terraform.tfvars.example`, with `enabled=false`.
  The AWS provider rejects an authenticated account different from `aws_account_id`.

Fetch the pinned Lambda archives and deploy the reviewed disabled plan:

```bash
bash fetch-lambdas.sh
terraform init -backend-config=/path/to/private/state.backend.hcl
terraform fmt -check
terraform validate
terraform plan -var-file=/path/to/private/deployment.tfvars.json -out=disabled.tfplan
terraform show disabled.tfplan
terraform apply disabled.tfplan
```

The initial plan has 86 managed creates, no updates/deletes and no EC2 instance.
The state backend, webhook secret and inactive GitHub hook are provisioned outside
that plan. Credentials, state, plans, variables and Lambda binaries are excluded
from Git. The binary archive digests are maintained in `lambdas.sha256`.

## Future activation

Activate only when requested. Keep the repository variable false while preparing:

1. Add `kangxyz/colib` to the existing GitHub App's selected repositories. The App
   needs repository Administration write, Actions read, Checks read and Metadata
   read, matching Aglib. The current CLI user token cannot change that App's
   repository selection (HTTP 403); this selection remains pending while dormant.
2. Apply a reviewed plan with `enabled=true`. It raises the runner maximum and
   reserved scale-up concurrency to one and enables binary synchronization.
3. Verify the runner distribution is available in the module's private S3 bucket.
   Configure the repository `workflow_job` hook with `terraform output -raw webhook_url`,
   the matching SSM webhook secret, JSON content type and SSL verification, then
   activate the hook. Keep the shared App-wide webhook settings unchanged.
4. Set `COLIB_SELF_HOSTED_ENABLED=true`. The manual EC2 probe with
   `verify-handoff=true` checks both jobs see the same runner/workspace. Dispatch
   the main-branch CI `ec2` profile and
   check the host marker, native checks, separate caches and idle termination.
   Only this trial establishes that the Colib runner actually works.

To suspend admission again, set the repository variable false, deactivate the
Colib hook, and apply `enabled=false`. Existing machines are reclaimed by idle
scale-down or the watchdog; changing these controls does not interrupt an active
machine immediately. Verify the Colib EC2 fleet and registered runners are empty.

## On-demand dependency warmup

Use `enabled=true` and `guarded_ci=true` to serve Colib CI and the
owner-dispatched **Dependency warmup** workflow on Colib branches. The
runner registers only the `colib-dependency-warmup` label and checks the
workflow path, event, ref and actors before executing job steps. It stays
available through the Build-to-Test handoff and scales down after the idle
grace period. A standalone `warmup_only=true` fleet can use one-job runners.

Set up this mode once.

1. Run `bash fetch-lambdas.sh` to verify the pinned upstream bundles and
   package the warmup webhook filter. Verify the GitHub App installation
   and runner distribution as above.
2. Keep `COLIB_SELF_HOSTED_ENABLED=false` during deployment and apply a
   reviewed plan with `-var enabled=true -var guarded_ci=true`.
3. Activate the Colib `workflow_job` hook and set
   `COLIB_DEPENDENCY_WARMUP_ENABLED=true` and `COLIB_SELF_HOSTED_ENABLED=true`
   after the workflow is available on `main`. A branch must contain the
   current workflow to select the guarded runner.

Keep the webhook and scale-up function available between jobs. This mode
has a single-runner cap and an empty idle pool. To suspend it, set
`COLIB_SELF_HOSTED_ENABLED=false`, remove `COLIB_DEPENDENCY_WARMUP_ENABLED`,
deactivate the hook and apply `enabled=false`.

## Standard EC2 runner for split CI

The split workflow uses the guarded high-memory runner to build dependencies
and a separate `m7i.xlarge` runner for Colib and its checks. Each fleet has a
single-runner cap. The standard runner uses the same Ubuntu, subnet, watchdog
and idle scale-down as the high-memory runner, with the separate
`colib-standard-ec2` label.

Apply the existing guarded CI configuration with `-var standard_enabled=true`
to provision the second fleet. Synchronize the runner distribution for its
bucket, then add a second repository `workflow_job` hook for
`terraform output -raw standard_webhook_url`, using the existing Colib hook
secret. Set `COLIB_STANDARD_RUNNER_ENABLED=true` after that hook is active.

## Parallel Colib CI

The optional parallel controller polls queued Build jobs from the Colib CI
workflow. It accepts owner pushes and manual runs for branches in the Colib
repository. Each attempt claims a lease before EC2 starts and registers one
runner with the private `colib-ci-run-<run>-<attempt>` label. Build and Test
use that label and check the runner and checkout identity at handoff.
The older shared runner stays available for earlier workflow copies,
dependency warmup, and split CI.

Build the pinned Lambda packages, including `parallel-controller.zip`, with
`bash fetch-lambdas.sh`. Review a Terraform plan with
`enabled=true`, `guarded_ci=true`, and `parallel_runner_limit=2` before
activating the controller. Publish the updated workflow and set
`COLIB_PARALLEL_RUNNER_ENABLED=true` to route ordinary CI to the private runners.
Existing branches need the updated workflow before they can use parallel CI.

The controller reconciles once a minute. It leaves additional runs in the
GitHub queue when both leases are occupied. EC2's client token makes launch
retries idempotent. Terminal runs release their instance and registration.
The runner watchdog also bounds the lifetime if the controller is unavailable.
Rerun all jobs when retrying a same-host build and test.
The GitHub App needs repository Administration write and Actions read. A run
whose assigned instance disappears may need manual cancellation and a full
rerun. Disable routing and allow active attempts to finish before removing
the controller.
