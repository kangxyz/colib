# The canonical K-to-G equivalence on regular schemes with the resolution property

Quillen's proved resolution theorem applies to actual finite vector-bundle
resolutions. Native Stacks perfectness and bounded replacement supply those
resolutions on a quasi-compact regular scheme with the resolution
property. The forward homomorphism remains the original `Scheme.KToG` in every
nonnegative degree, including zero. No dimension bound or global projectivity
hypothesis is introduced.

Implementation provenance: the canonical factorization in
`Quillen/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme/Regular/GeneralComparison.lean` at commit
`c561118b7795eb9780be9ed391c3251d6a4d0afd`; its algebraic resolution premise is
here discharged using the native Stacks results, Tags 0FDC and 0F8E.
